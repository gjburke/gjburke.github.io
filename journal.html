            This is where I'm going to talk about what I've done for the day, what I've learned, etc.
            Hopefully with time, I can become better at reflecting on my code, how I have grown, and how 
            I can grow more. The ability to reflect and grow from the challenges of each day is something
            that I want to continue working on.

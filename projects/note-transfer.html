<p>WIP: We are transferring notes</p>

<section>
    <h2>Update as of 6/27/25</h2>
    <p>
        I'm trying to allocate some time to get this done. I think
        at least on the weekends I should be good. I'm sort of balancing
        three different responsibilities with CAing, Research, and KWF right now,
        which all together are feeling like a full time position. So I'm finding time. 
        Cause this is a cool project!
    </p>
    <p>
        Right now I've made a very rudimentary version, that just reads
        the text off of given images using a pretrained model off HuggingFace.
        Super simple, and not very useful. I want to figure how to expand this,
        since there's different ways I could go. Like:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding support for PDF uploads, splitting into images</li>
        <li>Training the model on my handwriting (and eventually custom training)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        And obviously down the road I'd be adding segmentation of the pages
        in order to format it correctly, better interactivity with reordering of pages,
        editting, etc, and more ideas. But we'll see where this project takes me.
        Overall, just hoping to get some time to it on the weekends/weeknights,
        and see what I can build.

        <h2>Quick Intro</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Griffin Burke, I'm coming into my Junior year at the 
            University of Illinois studying Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics
            (and probably Statistics soon as well).
        </p>
        <p>
            I know I'm interested in AI/ML, that sort of sphere, but I'm still exploring the different
            areas within it that I might want to work with. I'm a big fan of building, creating AI-integrated
            apps to solve problems that I have. But that never seems to scratch the itch that research does,
            where I'm really getting into the technical aspects of how these models that I'm using actually work,
            and how we can improve their architecture and deployment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Within the next year I'm aiming to be a part of that research space and really dig deep,
            seeing if the type of work is for me, while learning a lot of AI/ML theory.
            I'd also like to learn how to work with large-scale AI applications. Most of what I've built
            is local, or simple API calls. I'd like to expand to cloud-based development and deployment
            of models and apps.

        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <p>I'm doing some cool things right now with different groups, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Developing a poacher detection system through extracting context from the bioacoustic soundscape of the rainforest
                (Kashmir World Foundation)
            </li>
            <li>
                Utilizing vision models to predict cow weight based off of overhead imaging (Illinois Digital Animal Systems Lab)
            </li>
            <li>
                Creating a note transfer application that is about to digitize notes into formatted markdown (Personal Project)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I'm always looking for interesting applications of AI that I can be a part of, so don't hesitate to reach out
            if you've got something you think I'll like! Even if I'm too busy at the moment to actually join, I'm always down 
            to meet people who are doing interesting things.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>For this site:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Refactor to be more mobile-friendly</li>
            <li>Use the note-transfer project to digitize my notes from my notebooks onto this site</li>
            <li>Once notes are digitized, can start trying out cool semantic modeling ideas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>School-wise: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Should be taking Artificial Intelligence (CS440) and Machine Learning (CS446) in Spring 2025 - finally!</li>
            <li>Around the same time (hopefully before), become a part of an AI research lab at UIUC, start doing interesting research</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Professionally: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I'll be working on this note-transfer app, should be done by the end of summer</li>
            <li>Learn more about distributed ML systems, how models are integrated and deployed into large-scale apps</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Quick Intro</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Griffin Burke, I'm currently in my Junior year at the 
            University of Illinois studying Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know I'm interested in AI/ML, that sort of sphere, but I'm still exploring the different
            areas within it that I might want to work with. I'm a fan of utilizing AI to solve problems that I have, 
            which is usually where my projects end up. But that never seems to scratch the itch that research does,
            where I'm really getting into the technical aspects of how these models that I'm using actually work,
            and how we can improve their architecture and deployment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Within the next year I'm aiming to truly become a part of that research space and really dig deep,
            seeing if the type of work is for me, while learning a lot of AI/ML theory.
            I'd also like to learn how to work with large-scale AI applications. Most of what I've built
            is local, or simple API calls. I'd like to expand to cloud-based development and deployment
            of models and apps.

        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <p>I'm doing some cool things right now with different groups, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Developing a poacher detection system through extracting context from the bioacoustic soundscape of the rainforest
                (Kashmir World Foundation)
            </li>
            <li>
                Utilizing vision models to predict cow weight based off of overhead imaging (Illinois Digital Animal Systems Lab)
            </li>
            <li>
                Creating a note transfer application that is about to digitize notes into formatted markdown (Personal Project)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I'm always looking for interesting applications of AI that I can be a part of, so don't hesitate to reach out
            if you've got something you think I'll like! Even if I'm too busy at the moment to actually join, I'm always down 
            to meet people who are doing interesting things.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>For this site:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Build out all the project pages for everything that I've done</li>
            <li>Use the note-transfer project to digitize my notes from my notebooks onto this site</li>
            <li>Once notes are digitized, can start trying out cool semantic modeling ideas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>School-wise: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I'll be taking Artificial Intelligence (CS440) and Deep Learning for Computer Vision (CS444) in Spring 2026 - finally!</li>
            <li>Continue working with the I-DigitAL research lab, focusing on building out the tools and systems for our vision-based weight system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Professionally: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I'll be working on this note-transfer app, looking to have a deployed beta by the start of next semester</li>
            <li>
                Will most likely be working the Data Engineer TDP Internship at AT&T this summer, 
                I'm looking to learn more about industry practices and tools, learning and experiencing as much as I can
            </li>
        </ul>

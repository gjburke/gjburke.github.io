By this weekend I should be able to update this site, get it to where I want it,
have everything that I want on it as well. The summer is starting up, and I want to 
improve on my journaling habits so this site will be a great way for me to do that.

I think I'll have to eventually make scripts for ease of use for this site in order 
to make sure I keep using it. I want to make logging everything as frictionless as can be
so that its easy for me to do and not not do. But that stuff will come after I actually 
get all of this stuff updated and situated.

Even after I get the layout done, I should still add some projects to the projects page,
things to my "About Me", and any other updates to the information on the site. Shouldn't be
too bad though. 

Excited to get started with this site! Hoping that I can use it well to help me learn, reflect, and grow!

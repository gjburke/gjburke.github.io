**Update as of 12/27/2025:** I don't have any plans on continuing this project, even though it's not complete. It was a summer 2024 project.

# Overview

The closet app that I was building is meant to be a mobile app that stores your clothes and allows you to create and visualize outfits on your phone. It's build using React with Typescript, with state management using React Redux Toolkit.

**Technologies:** React Native, React Redux Toolkit, TypeScript

**Concepts:** Mobile Development

# Takeaways

I'm making this document a while after the fact (about a year and a half) so I have limited insight on this.

It turned out that designing all the backend, frontend, and their interactions was a lot. I wasn't able to get to all the features I wanted to during the summer, and school work just took up too much bandwidth to really finish any of this after. 

But I can definitely say that this project helped me understand the scale of modern apps, and how much goes into programming them. I will say that I may have been a little misguided with my development, maybe a little over my head. I definitely needed more tools (like a database system and ORM) in order to achieve what I wanted. With that knowledge now, I may revisit it, but I have other responsibilities right now. Maybe over the summer.

Other than that though, I would say this really through me into the fire on React and how it works. I was figuring out the foundations (hooks, state management, components, props) for the first time, which was really helpful when doing any other sort of front-end in the future. Along with that, getting used to this component-centered structure was a new type of paradigm that I remember liking a lot more than the painful HTML things I was doing. In the end, this project introduced me to frameworks and ideas that I'd have to utilize in the future.

I learned from this that I don't see myself ever really getting good at frontend development. I just find the type of work I did here a lot more monotonous. I was really trying to create this basic app so I could add segmentation models and outfit recommendation systems. But making a whole app just to make those just wasn't the move. Possibly over the summer though, I may dabble in this again (with a much more clear picture) to give myself the opportunity to add those interesting features. Not sure if it'll be wroth my time though.

As you can see with this site and my subsequent projects, front end probably won't be very important for me in the future. I'll keep it light.

# Approach

I think my approach was too simple and not though out enough for this app, which is partly why it didn't end up being developed the whole way. I tried to just use redux for storage, but for this type of app, it probably would've been better to have some sort of database system (local or not). Now that I have more experience with that due to my class, I may be able to refactor this project to something I like. It would take a lot of time and work that I just don't have right now, though.

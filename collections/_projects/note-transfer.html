    <strong>Update as of 12/26/2025:</strong> This project is still in progress.
    I started it in May 2025 and have worked on it when I have the bandwidth since then.
    I'm looking to have a working, barebones version by the end of January 2026.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The note transfer tool is being built to parse written notes into a text tree,
        allowing for digitization and export into formats such as markdown and html.
        It uses Ultralytics's YOLO detection models for structure recognition
        and Microsoft's TrOCR model for text recognition.
        Through a simple interface built with Svelte, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS,
        users will be able to upload their scanned documents and convert them to a structured document.

# Introduction

*(12/16/2025)*

*I just got this book for Christmas, and the title sounded really interesting. Even from a non-coding context, I know that life revolves around a lot of systems, so knowing how to identify them and possibly change them would be really helpful. Similarly, this perspective will also be helpful in my profession since I'll likely be a part of building ML systems, as well as exist in corporate, research, and/or development systems.*

This book starts off outlining some of the reasons why systems are so important, as well as relating it to some old adages. I recently watched a youtube video recently where the person basically said to "trust the ancestral knowledge" found in small phrases. So it's interesting to see that you can relate (at least some of) these phrases to the phenomenon that arise form systems. "Don't have all your eggs in one basket" is a pretty simple example of this, where a system with multiple paths and redundancies will be more resilient than one with only one way of working.

*I'm hoping to finish this book by the end of my break (around mid-January) and start reading regularly off of that momentum. We'll see how that goes, as I haven't been great about doing that in the past. But I'm feeling I need a change of pace, that I need to grow. So things feel different.*

*With these notes, I'm going to try figuring out how I can include my thoughts along with the facts and thoughts of the book/author. For now, I may put my thoughts in italics. It may be hard sometimes to draw distinction between my paraphrasing of the book (what I thought I learned) versus my thoughts on the book (ideas about what the book is saying, how I can apply it) but I'll try my best.*

# Part One: Systems Structure and Behavior

## The Basics

The three key parts of a system: **entities**, **interconnections**, **function/purpose**.

With such a broad definition, you can classify many things as a system, each likely having their own subsystems and subclasses of each part within themselves.

There is also a different "impact" of each part. A system like a basketball game, for example, can change out entities (players, coaches, fans) and still be the same... but change the interconnections (rules of the game) or purpose (trying to lose instead of win) and its a completely different system. But, we must keep in mind that even though there is this "importance" difference, all elements of a system play a part in it.

Another thing we see with systems is that undesireable things arise. Nobody wants drug addiction to be a thing, but combine many different connections and purposes within a system and its subsystems (desperate people who want relief, doctors and farmers with incentive for money, criminals who can operate outside the bounds of the law, police who want to catch those criminals, the government banning a substance, ...) then we see this arise. No one really created or planned the system to have this arise, but it is a product of the systems we have set up.

*Just off this intro section, I appreciate the way this information is presented, and the "simplicity" of this framework of thinking. Obviously, what arises from it is not simple at all. But I hope that as we get into the details of the future "system zoo" that I can start recognizing these things in my life. Learning a new perspective on things in this world, a new way to conceive of the things around me and that happen to me, is a good way to get the brain juices flowing. I hope to be able to look at the world in this systems way so that I can utilize the perspective it brings, both in my own personal life (to set up systems that give me success) and professionally (to set up systems to give others and my organization success). I'll have to learn to recognize the systems first, and I have a feeling that changing and thinking of new systems will be a challange, but I'm up for it! I'm excited to see how this book will go.*

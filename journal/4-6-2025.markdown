title: I Will Use This One Day
date: 4/6/2025

Just updated the front page and about page. Realizing I haven't touched this in three months to I included a disclaimer about how long it has been since its been edited. Even though I'm not really advertising this site anywhere, don't ever want to put something out that is this sloppy too often.

I actually do want to use this site. I think it can be a great way for me to store so many things that I've learned within computer science. These journals especailly can help me reflect on my programming, direction professionally, and overall learning trajectory. This would be really beneficial to a lot of aspects of my computer science knowledge and intuition, if I coudl just stay on track.

This inconsistency (or just never starting) with jounraling on here is also consistent with real life. I'm not journaling, taking those mind-calming things. Really just focused on working and school and finding space to have a good time as well. But I should probably also be "working on myself" as they say. A nice jounraling habit would work well.

But as they say, one day or day one. And I think I'm at a one day stage right now. Maybe soon (summer?) I'll find it in myself to start journaling here and in my own books. This vaguely depends on this next week, going to see if I get my first internship offer (which I really want, seems right up my alley). We'll see though.

Best of luck to you, have a good one!

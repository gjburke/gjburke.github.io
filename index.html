            This website was last updated on: <strong>4/6/2025</strong> (was just some minor updates to main and about pages)

            I tend to get focused on work and school, all that type of stuff. So this website may be left for a while time to time.
            If you are interested in my work and this isn't being actively updated, please reach out at my email (in about section)!

        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Griffin Burke, I am a sophomore at the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign studying
            Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics (and possibly Data Science too).
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm very interested in AL/ML/All those buzzwords, and am looking to gain more experience in each aspect of
            that overall field. That would be pipelines to handle data, creating the models, to implementing them in software,
            to name a few.
        </p>

            <li>
                Creating vision models to predict cow weight based off of overhead imaging (Illinois Digital Animal Systems Lab)

            I'm always looking for interesting applications of AI that I can be a part of, so don't hesitate to reach out
            if you've got something you think I'll like! Even if I'm too busy at the moment to actually join, I'm always down 
            to meet people who are doing interesting things.

            I tend to get focused on work and school, all that type of stuff. So this website may be left for a while time to time.
            If you are interested in my work and this isn't being actively updated, please reach out at my email (in the about page)!

        <h2>Hi! Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Griffin Burke, I am an undergrad student at the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign studying
            Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics (and probably Statistics soon as well).

        <h2>My Stuff</h2>
        <p>
            This site is meant to be a hub of what I think about, learn, and create. 
            Right now, it's mainly focused on computer science, but who knows where life will take me :)
        </p>
        <p>Here is what's on this site:</p>
        <ul id="topics-list">
            {% for page in site.data.navigation %}
                <li><a href="{{ page.link }}"><strong>{{ page.name }}</strong></a> - {{ page.description }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>

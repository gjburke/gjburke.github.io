        <p>
            I'm building this site for me, but if you happen to not be me and are on this site, 
            hello! Welcome!
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Griffin Burke, I am currently a sophomore at the 
            University of Illinois studying Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics
            (and possibly Data Science too, we'll see) and an interest in quantum computing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm interested in a lot of things and am still exploring many aspects of computer science.
            However, I've found myself drawn to the ML/AI/Data Science aspects of computer science
            recently. General topics of interest in that area would be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>ML/AI Engineering</b>: Building, training, tuning, and maintaining models </li>
            <li><b>Data Science/Engineering</b>: Working with, modeling large and complex datasets</li>
            <li><b>MLOps</b>: Designing, implementing, maintaining ML/AI/Data pipelines</li>
            <li><b>Software Engineering</b>: with a focus on implementing AI/ML models into software</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Right now I'm learning and gaining experience with more rigor in Machine Learning Engineering
            (assuring proper documentation, using pipelines for proper data handling, generally more 
            methodical work). I'd like to gain more expereince in those things, as well as what goes into 
            deploying an ML/AI model (MLOps and backend pipelines, but also within the front end of the software).
        </p>
        <p>So yeah, that's a little about me. If you want to want to get to know me more, my email is {{ page.email }}.</p>

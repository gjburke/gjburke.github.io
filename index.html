                    My name is Griffin Burke, I am an undergrad student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying
                    Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics.

                    I have a keen interest in ML/AI and its variety of useful applications,
                    and am currently doing research, personal projects, and internships to pursue that interest.

        <h2>My Site</h2>
        <p>
            This site is meant to be a hub of what I think about, learn, and create. 
            Right now, it's mainly focused on computer science, but who knows where life will take me.
        </p>
        <p>Here's what is on this site:</p>
        <ul id="topics-list">
            {% for page in site.data.navigation %}
                <li><a href="{{ page.link }}"><strong>{{ page.name }}</strong></a> - {{ page.description }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
        <p id="resume-container">
            <span>Oh and if you're a recruiter, here's my resume(s):</span>

            I tend to get focused on work and school, all that type of stuff. So this website may be left for a while time to time.
            If you are interested in my work and this isn't being actively updated, please reach out at my email (in the about page)!
